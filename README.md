# 🧠 FocusZone — A Daily Task + Quote App

FocusZone is a minimal yet powerful productivity app built with pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Designed for daily use and deep learning, this app helps users organize tasks and stay inspired with refreshing quotes — all while staying completely frontend-only with no backend or frameworks involved.

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This project is part of a learning journey focused on:
- Strengthening **JavaScript fundamentals** like DOM manipulation & events
- Writing clean, modular, and reusable **frontend logic**
- Practicing **responsive UI design** without relying on external libraries
- Building confidence by doing it **independently, line by line**

> ⚙️ Built as Stage 1 in a personal roadmap:  
> `Frontend Only → Backend Only → Fullstack → AI + Systems`

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Creating modular JavaScript with clearly separated functions
- Handling edge cases (empty input, duplicate task etc.)
- Improving responsiveness with pure CSS

---

## 🛠️ Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

- Theme switch (dark/light mode)
- Add timestamps for each task
- Sorting tasks alphabetically or by creation time
- Export/Import task list as JSON
